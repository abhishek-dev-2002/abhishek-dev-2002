## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 gRPC API Rate Limiter
Developed a gRPC API rate limiter in Go with Redis and Protocol Buffers, using fixed-window counters and
interceptors to handle high-throughput requests while preventing API overuse and ensuring fair resource distribution.
**Tech:** Go, gRPC, Protobuf, Redis

### 🔹 Distributed Notification System
Designed a Kafka-based distributed notification system supporting **real-time and bulk**
delivery for push, email, SMS, and in-app notifications.

**Design focus:**
- Event-driven architecture using Kafka  
- Horizontal scaling via partitioned consumers  
- Retry handling and fault tolerance  
- Idempotent processing to avoid duplicate notifications  
- Observability using logs and metrics  

*(Design-focused; code not public)*

### 🔹 Multi-Tenant Backend Architecture
Designed a scalable backend architecture with **database-per-tenant isolation**
to ensure strong data separation, security, and predictable performance across tenants.

**Design focus:**
- Tenant-level isolation using separate MongoDB databases  
- Dedicated Redis instances for caching and rate limiting  
- Stateless backend services for horizontal scalability  
- Clear trade-offs between isolation, cost, and operational complexity  

*(Architecture & design work based on production experience)*
